          <h1 >“Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a 
            man of value.” <b>Albert Einstein</b></span></h1>  
          <p class="lead">
            Friends, I, a common man can change and develop one and all, if 
            you listen to my words; and think, self-analyse and experiment in your life 
            with the understanding and insights hidden behind my words. Friends, after 
            joining govt. service in the Indian Navy, I felt a deep inner-motivation to do 
            something for development of people, and with the same motivation; I
            started writing books. 
            <br><br>
            And, from a few days, my being or soul (whatever 
            you name it), started inducing and compelling me to do something 
            “differently” in this regard, and therefore now I have started making 
            YouTube videos and speaking on ‘Podcast’ with a channel name – “Yes! 
            We Can Change India”, to fulfill my same aim and ambition. And, I think in 
            my whole life, including my future lives also, even I reach a little closer to 
            this big aim; that is, development of one and all; it will be a great pleasure 
            and satisfaction for me</p>

        <h1 >The Existence is Our <b>Real Creator</b></span></h1>  
        <p class="lead">
          Friends, we all are children of the same womb of the creator-existence. 
The creator-existence has transformed chemical substances into a cell and 
this cell has been sprouted and developed in the form of a living world, and 
humanity is a part of this living world. Though, some religious and spiritual 
people believe that we have been created by a God— an unknown body; it 
is only a belief and not a proven reality. Reality, as proven by science is 
only this that we are all products of the nature and existence. 

<br><br>
We have 
been created and developed on this earth after a long process of action and reaction, mutation and evolution. So, we are all children of the same nature 
and existence. Furthermore, though, among ourselves, superficially we 
may have some differences like different gender, colors and shapes; or our 
own created differences like caste, tradition, religion, nationality etc., 
however, we are all children of the same creator. Additionally, we should 
be aware that though humanity has been developed to the modern science 
age, observing the vastness and harsh conditions of the universe, this 
beautiful blue-planet earth seems as a womb (a safe place) for us. 
<br><br>
Even 
today, we are not in a position to leave this planet and go to some other 
planet. In fact, modern science has not found any other planet in our whole 
galaxy or nearby galaxy, which is more beautiful and safer than our mother 
earth. Therefore, even today, we are like babies in the womb of the creator. </p>
