          <h1 >Leave Past and Utilize Present for better<b>Growth and Development</b></span></h1>  
          <p class="lead">
            Friends, people have this belief that we face problems and difficulties in our 
present life due to our past-life karma, in fact, past-life bad karma. 
Certainly, it is true that action-reaction and cause and effect always go 
together, but it is not true that creator-existence punishes us in our present
life for our past-life karma. In fact, this existence is so kind and 
compassionate that it can bear any wound without hurting us. 
            <br><br>
            riends, we 
should be aware that like a mother produces her baby to love, care and 
development; the creator-existence has produced us for our growth and 
development and not for punishing us. Notwithstanding, even this 
existence finds someone in an unhealthy state— ignorant, egoist, greedy, 
angered and violent; instead of punishing him; it puts its best effort to make 
him healthy, sensible, intelligent and developed. Because, even an 
unhealthy person is like a cell of the creator’s huge body, so there is no 
question of punishing its own cell. Therefore, this compassionate and 
awaken existence always cares us and it makes a sincere effort to make 
us healthy, developed and virtuous. However, due to ignorance and false 
spiritual and religious belief-system, we have created this false belief that 
God punishes us for our past karmas.</p>

        <h1 >The Existence Is Purely <b>Fair and Lovely</b></span></h1>  
        <p class="lead">
          Friends, the facts and findings of modern science prove that nature is 
purely fair and crystal-clear. How, I explain here— the elementary particles 
of the existence like atoms and electrons are purely fair and unbiased. For 
example, everyone is same for an electron. It does not think—who is who 
or what. One may be a top most scientist, but an electron does not care; 
because it gives the same electric-shock to him what it gives to an illiterate. 
It does not differentiate between them. This clearly shows that nature and 
existence are purely fair and unbiased. In fact, this is the reason why in the 
spirituality it is said that everyone is same in the ‘eye’ of God; and that God 
is this existence. In addition, we should be aware that the intrinsic virtue of 
elementary particles does not change with time. An electron or an atom 
does not change with time, they are always same. It shows that this 
existence is fair and unbiased from the eternity. 

<br><br>
WFurther, it is said that time is a great pain-balm. Time can heal our 
every wound. However, this is not the actual reality. The actual reality is 
that it is not the time; rather it is the healing-virtue of the nature (elementary 
particles) which heals our every wound. If there will be no healing-virtue in 
the nature, our wounds can never be healed. This healing-virtue of nature 
clearly shows that the existence is very loving and caring. It loves and 
cares us like a mother. In fact, the basic aim of the creator behind our 
creation is to care and develop us, so that we may be able to emerge out 
our in-built virtue, talent and intelligence; which the existence has been 
developing within us since eternity.</p>
